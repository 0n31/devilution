# DevilutionX
Diablo build for modern operating systems

# How To Play:
 - Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD, or GoG install folder, to the DevilutionX game directory ; Make sure it is all lowercase.
 - [Download DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases), or build from source
 - Install SDL2 (including SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf) make sure to get the appropriate 32bit or 64bit version.
 - Run `./devilutionx`

Please keep in mind that this is still being worked on and is missing parts of UI and some minor bugs: https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/milestone/1

# Building from Source
See the section for your platform on our wiki page [Compiling form Source](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Compiling-from-Source)

# Multiplayer
 - TCP/IP only requires the host to expose port 6112
 - UPD/IP requires that all players expose port 6112

All games are encrypted and password protected.

Here are some screenshots to demonstrate the relative ease of improving the game:

# F.A.Q.
> Wow, does this mean I can download and play Diablo for free now?

No, you'll need access to the data from the original game. To get a legitimate copy of the game assets, please refer to the [GoG release of Diablo 1](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo).
> Ok, so I'm playing DevilutionX now and all the sudden it crashed. NOW WHAT??

Open an issue and provide as much information as possible (OS version, etc.) including any crash logs.
> I thought I'd fix the crash myself, but after looking at the code its a disaster. Do you speak v2-34-v8?

That is the result of decompiled code. Whenever a program is compiled, much of the source is optimized and stripped away, so it's nearly impossible to decompile it back. Have patience. Everything will be cleaned up eventually. :)
